      TECHNICAL APPROACH FOR ROUND 1A
echnical Solution Architecture

1. Advanced PDF Parsing Strategy
Primary Technology: PyMuPDF (fitz)
Core Capabilities:
High-Performance Parsing: Direct access to PDF structure without rendering overhead
Font Metadata Extraction: Font size, family, weight, and style information
Spatial Layout Analysis: Bounding box coordinates for text positioning
Multi-Page Processing: Efficient page-by-page text block extraction
Key Advantage: Offline processing with sub-second per-page performance, enabling real-time
document analysis without external dependencies.

2. Intelligent Text Block Processing
Normalization Pipeline:
Whitespace Filtering: Remove empty blocks and normalize spacing
Block Consolidation: Group fragmented text lines using coordinate proximity
Metadata Preservation: Maintain font properties and positional data
Character Encoding: Handle special characters and Unicode properly
Data Structure for Each Block:
Text content (cleaned and normalized)
Font size (in points)
Font family and weight indicators
Bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height)
Page number reference


3. Font-Based Hierarchy Detection
Statistical Font Analysis Approach
Step 3.1: Font Size Distribution Analysis
Collect all unique font sizes across the document
Calculate frequency distribution of each font size
Apply clustering algorithms (K -means with k=4-5) to identify distinct size groups
Rank clusters by size to establish hierarchy
Step 3.2: Hierarchical Level Assignment
Title Level: Largest font size, typically on first page
H1 Level: Second largest size group, often bold
H2 Level: Third largest size group
H3 Level: Fourth largest or bold variants of smaller sizes

4. Advanced Heading Classification R
ules
Multi-Criteria Heading Detection:
Criteria Set A: Textual Characteristics
Length Filter: â‰¤ 15 words (configurable threshold)
Sentence Structure: No ending punctuation (period/comma)
Capitalization Patterns: Title case or ALL CAPS detection
Numeric Prefixes: Section numbering (1., 1.1, A., etc.)
Criteria Set B: Spatial Layout
Alignment Detection: Left-aligned, center-aligned, or indented positioning
Isolation Check: Surrounded by whitespace (not inline with paragraphs)
Page Position: Top 80% of page preferred for headings
Margin Analysis: Consistent left margins for same-level headings
Criteria Set C: Typographic Features
Font Weight: Bold, semi-bold, or heav
y weight detection
Font Style: Italic variants for sub-headings
Color Analysis: Different colors for hierarchy (if available)
Underline/Formatting: Additional formatting indicators

 Title Extraction Methodology
Multi-Phase Title Detection
Phase 1: First Page Analysis
Focus on top 30% of first page
Identify largest font size in this region
Check for center alignment or prominent positioning
Verify isolation from other text blocks

Phase 2: Validation Checks
Length Validation: Reasonable title length (5-50 words)
Content Analysis: Avoid headers/footers, page numbers
Contextual Relevance: Should relate to document content
Format Consistency: Matches expected title formatting

Phase 3: Fallback Strategies
Search in document metadata if available
Look for title patterns in first few pages
Use filename as last resort (cleaned and formatted)
